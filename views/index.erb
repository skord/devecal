<p>Hate Logging into EVE gate to check your calendar? Got a nifty smart phone and want to subscribe to your calendar?</p>

<p>Using your API key, this app will fetch the XML for your characters on your account and convert that to an ical formatted file you can subscribe to.</p>

<p>The results are cached for 15 minutes, so your API key won't be hit more often than that</p>
<br />

<h3>Two Easy Steps:</h3>
<br />
  <ol>
    <li>Create an minimal API Key: <a href='https://support.eveonline.com/api/Key/CreatePredefined/1048580/0/false'>EVE Support Portal</a></li>
    <li>Come back here, put in the API details <a href='/characters'>here</a>, and get your links to your calendars!</li>
  </ol>
